# Insipid3D

Insipid3D is a small lightweight 3D OpenGL game engine.
A few years ago I wrote [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYRhSKjlKws) engine and have been meaning to rewrite it forever.

The goal of the project is to build a networked game engine with graphics that sit comfortably in the beginning of the last decade. The goal certainly isn't to build the best game engine ever to grace github with its presence. It's more of a hobby project and test-bed for experimenting with modern C++ / OpenGL.
# Building
